### üß™ How It Works

1. **Upload** your FAQ CSV (columns: `question`, `answer`)
2. The app:
   - Cleans and summarizes answers
   - Embeds them using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
   - Stores them in a FAISS index
3. **Ask a question** in the chat box
4. The system:
   - Finds the most semantically similar FAQ
   - Sends it (and your question) to the LLM via Together API
   - Translates (if needed) and displays the answer

---

### üåç Multilingual Support

- Detects Arabic or English inputs
- Translates both directions for full understanding
- Can be extended to more languages
